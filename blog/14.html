                <h2>What is Dollar-Cost Averaging?</h2>
              
                <p class="content">
                    Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy that helps reduce the impact of market volatility by investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. This method is particularly helpful for new investors and those seeking a long-term, disciplined approach.
                
                    <strong>1. How It Works:</strong> Instead of investing a lump sum all at once, you invest smaller amounts on a consistent schedule—such as monthly—into a specific investment like a mutual fund, stock, or ETF.
                
                    <strong>2. Reduces Timing Risk:</strong> Since you're not trying to time the market, DCA helps reduce the risk of making poor investment decisions based on short-term market fluctuations.
                
                    <strong>3. Buys More When Prices Are Low:</strong> When the market dips, your fixed investment buys more shares. When prices rise, it buys fewer. Over time, this can lead to a lower average cost per share.
                
                    <strong>4. Encourages Discipline:</strong> DCA promotes regular investing habits and keeps you committed to your financial goals, regardless of market emotions or fear.
                
                    <strong>5. Ideal for Long-Term Goals:</strong> This strategy works best when used over a long period—such as saving for retirement or a child’s education—where consistent contributions matter more than short-term gains.
                
                    <strong>6. Works Well with Automatic Investing:</strong> Many financial platforms allow you to automate investments on a set schedule, making DCA easy to implement without constant effort.
                
                    <strong>7. Not Always the Highest Return:</strong> While DCA reduces risk, it may not produce the highest returns in rapidly rising markets compared to lump-sum investing. However, it provides peace of mind and lowers the emotional stress of investing.
                
                    Dollar-cost averaging is a smart way to build wealth steadily and safely, especially for those new to investing or concerned about market ups and downs.
